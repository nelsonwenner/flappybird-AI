  Flappy Bird AI

## About the project
An AI project aimed at playing the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird" was designed using a combination of neural networks and genetic algorithms. The neural network acts as a deep learning model, which is trained to recognize patterns in the game and make decisions based on those patterns. The genetic algorithm would then be used to optimize the weights and biases of the neural network, selecting the best-performing models and using them to create the next generation of models. The training and optimization process would continue until the AI learned to play successfully. The final AI model is able to make real-time decisions to guide the bird through the pipes and score the highest possible points. The implementation of both techniques can lead to a powerful AI system that can learn from its own experience and continually improve its performance.
